🛣️ **6-Month Roadmap**

### **Month 1: ML Basics + Math**

**Goal:**
Understand how ML works, types of models, core metrics, and pipeline structure.

**What to do:**

📘 **Book/Course:**

* Andrew Ng (Coursera) — *must-have*
* Alternative: *FastAI — Practical Deep Learning for Coders*

🧮 **Math:**

* Khan Academy: linear algebra, statistics, derivatives
* Visualizations: 3Blue1Brown — especially gradients and matrices

👨‍💻 **Code:**

* Implement 5–6 algorithms (linear regression, logistic regression, KNN, decision trees, naive Bayes, SVM) using scikit-learn
* Complete a few Kaggle notebooks (e.g., Titanic)

---

### **Month 2: Practical ML**

**Goal:**
Learn to work with real tabular data: preprocessing, validation, hyperparameter tuning.

**What to do:**

📘 **Book/Course:**

* *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow* (Chapters 1–10)

👨‍💻 **Practice:**

* Solve 3–4 Kaggle problems (e.g., House Prices, Credit Card Fraud)
* Use pipelines, `GridSearchCV`, `cross_val_score`

📦 **Tools:**

* Practice with Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Start using MLflow or Weights & Biases (W\&B) for experiment tracking

---
